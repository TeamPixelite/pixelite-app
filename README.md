# Introduction

Pixelite is a React Native app that provides unique features to travel enthusiasts. You can easily create a travel story out of selected photos, share your stories on the platform, and search for other stories when you're planning your next adventure.

These are some of the features Pixelite can offer:

- create travel stories with a timeline and places you've visited only with a few simple steps
- make a personalized world map with all the places you've travelled to
- check out other people's stories by searching for a location(city, country, or name of a specific place) and/or a keyword(e.g. surfing, mountain, food) that you're interested in

# Attention

## Client-side

Pixelite utilizes multiple API keys that are used to access login and geolocation information. In order to run the app, create a file named **"apis.js"** under the project folder with the following template. You will need to get your own API keys from Google and AWS.

<pre><code>
exports.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = "*****************************";
exports.GOOGLE_FIREBASE_API_KEY = "*****************************";
exports.AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "*****************************";
exports.AWS_SECRET_KEY = "*****************************";

</pre></code>


## Server-side

1. Go to PixeliteServer > config, and create a file named **"dev.js"** with the following template. You can get your MongoDB URI after going through the steps in 'Quick-Start Guide to mLab'(http://docs.mlab.com/).

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: ‘mongodb://*****:*****@******.mlab.com:*****/your-projectname’,
};
```

2. Configure AWS
